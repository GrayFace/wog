**FERAL HABITAT (script86.erm)
**by Rich Reed (a.k.a. "NexusPurple")

**LAST UPDATED: 5.12(December).2006 by samot (Thomas Franz) - removing triple "!" because of ERM-Errors
**UPDATED: Friday, September 16, 2005

**This structure uses Object type 63, subtype 61 in the Castle Objects in the Map Editor.
**It is the plain-looking cave with the black squarish entrance surrounded by a few green
**trees, and it is the 21st object underneath the RAMPART town in the Map Editor.

**The Feral Habitat is the Heroes of Might and Magic version of a zoo.  In each habitat are
**a wide variety of beasts, which are kept by a resident Beastmaster.  The visiting hero can
**only enter the habitat by first paying a special currency to the Beastmaster called
**"Beast Medallions".  These medallions can only be collected by visiting the following places
**on the Adventure Map:

********************************************************************************************
*1.  WINDMILL (only if the hero receives resources from it)
*2.  CAMPFIRE (always)
*3.  FLOTSAM (always)
*4.  SHIPWRECK SURVIVOR (always)
*5.  SWAN POND (only if the hero receives luck)
*6.  WATER WHEEL (only if the hero receives gold)
*7.  MAGIC SPRING (only if the hero's spell points are doubled)
*8.  WELL (only if spell points are filled to maximum)
*9.  MERMAID (only if the hero gains luck from her)
*10. MYSTICAL GARDEN (only if hero gets gold or gems from the leprechaun)
*11. CORPSE (only if the hero finds an artifact)
*12. OASIS (only if hero gains morale)
*13. WATERING HOLE (only if hero gains morale)
*14. BLACK MARKET (hero can steal some, but there's a chance you'll get caught and LOSE medallions!)
*15. JUNK MERCHANT (hero can steal some here also, and again costs movement points to take time to do it)
*16. TRADING POST (hero can steal medallions here also, and again a chance you'll LOSE medallions!)
*17. MARKET OF TIME (hero can sacrifice movement points to get medallions)

******************************************************************************************

**To view a hero's current amount of accumulated Beast edallions, simply RIGHT CLICK on
**the "Sleep/Wake Hero" button while any hero is selected while on the Adventure Map.  The
**special bitmap image file called "beast.jpg" must be placed in the Heroes3/DATA/s directory
**on your hard drive so that the image of the Beast Medallion will appear in a special
**dialogue box when you RIGHT CLICK on the "Sleep/Wake Hero" button.

**Once the hero gains entrance into the habitat, he/she will earn experience points
**depending on both the number and types of animals present.  In essence, the hero is "learning"
**about the creatures that he/she is seeing.

**The Feral Habitats only house rare and unique beasts that have been captured from all around
**the land of Erathia and beyond! All of the beasts are ones that I made up!

**There are always THREE different types of beasts available at any Feral Habitat
**every day.  The types of creatures present are maintained by random number generators.
**There is always one of each creature and each one awards a different amount of experiecne
**to the hero.

**The different beasts are only represented by the special image files that accompany this script.
**There are 224 total possible creatures that can exist at the Feral Habitats!  Each Beastmaster
**keeps 7 possible different types in their own unique habitat, but only 3 of their 7 types exist
**at once.  The different creatures change weekly.

**There are 32 possible Beastmasters that guard the Feral Habitats. The different Beastmasters
**are people I also made up and gave fake names to in order to make the Feral Habitat seem truly unique.
**Special PCX files are needed here also so that their profile photos appear in their corresponding
**dialogue boxes when a hero visits any habitat.  The Beastmasters names are as follows:
*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*(1)  VERTIGO
*(2)  DAR QUIOTHA
*(3)  CYCLONE
*(4)  VEREX
*(5)  SUMAC

*(30) SOLARIS

*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The beasts in each habitat change for each hero EVERY time a habitat is visited!  Thus, it is rare that two
**different heroes will get to see the exact same animals upon visiting the same habitat on the same day.

**A hero may visit and gain experience from the same habitat as many times as he/she wishes.....as long as he/she
**has the required amount of Beast Medallions AND has enough movement points left, as learning about the creatures
**causes the hero to tire and lose movement points :-)
