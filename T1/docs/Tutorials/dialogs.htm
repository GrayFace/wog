	<h1>Setting up tests environment.</h1>
	<p>Let's start by setting up the environment for simple tests. Create <i>ModTest</i> folder.
		Copy the <i>Maps</i> folder from this tutorial into the game folder.
		Start the the game on <i>!ModTest! Ascension</i> map. Save the game as <i>ModTest</i>.
		Now you'll quickly get into it when you need to test something out.
		The script in the map will run <i>ModTest\Test.lua</i> script whenever you click the right button.
		The file will be reloaded each time, so you won't need to restart the map when you change it.
		The <i>Code</i> folder contains <i>Test.lua</i> files that should be copied into <i>ModTest</i> folder.</p>


	<h1>Tutorial 1. Quest Log with custom content.</h1>
	<p>Do you remember the Papyrus (<i>!!QW</i>)? It's an old custom quest log for ERM.
		In this tutorial we will test out creation of a prettier custom quest log and play with aligning rules.</p>
		
	<h3><u>Step 1.</u> Quest Log picture with a few static controls.</h3>
	<p>So, <i>QuestLog.pcx</i> is the background picture. Size of the dialog is derived from the picture.
		On it we create a few controls, setting their coordinates explicitely. 
		<i>CloseDialog = true</i> attribute of the button, naturally, makes it close the dialog when pressed.
		Note that <i>HotKey = 28</i> stands for Enter key, as seen on <i>HeroesKeys.png</i>.
		Eventhough we've only created a few controls, you can see that coordinates calculation got a bit messy.
		In complex dialogs this may get far worse.</p>
	<div class="img"><img src="./img/T1S1.png" /></div>
	
	<h3><u>Step 2.</u> Using Align controls.</h3>
	<p>Now, to avoid dealing with coordinates directly each time we'll use horizontal Align control.
		<br/><i>Margin</i> is the space around its contents, SpaceX is the space between items in it.
		<br/><i>ExpandWidth = 1</i> makes the text occupy all free space horizontally.
		<br/><i>ExpandHeight = 1</i> makes it occupy the whole height of Align control, 
		which would be equal to height of the biggest control, Archer portrait.
		<br/>The result of this step looks identical to <i>Step 1</i> result.</p>
	
	<h3><u>Step 3.</u> Adding more stuff.</h3>
	<p>Now we're gonna put a vertical list. For this we would put a number of horizontal Align controls into a vertical Align control.
		<br/>Again, <i>ExpandWidth = 1</i> on AlignH controls makes them occupy whole width of the list.
		The content of AlignH controls is pretty random and serves to show different ways to align stuff.
		<br/>The third AlignH control has <i>AlignX = 0.5</i> attribute. It makes the contents centered horizontally.
		You can also use <i>AlignX = 1</i> value to align the contents to the right 
		or you can use any other value between <i>0</i> and <i>1</i>.</p>
	<div class="img"><img src="./img/T1S3.png" /></div>
	
	<h3><u>Step 4.</u> Scrolling.</h3>
	<p>Here I simply duplicated contents of the list and added <i>Shaded = true</i> attribute to the duplicates to make them distinct.
		<br/>To make the list scroll I moved the scrollbar into <i>ScrollBar</i> attribute of the vertical Align control.
		Scrolling is supported by the control out of the box.
		<br/>Additionally, I added <i>CatchKeys = true</i> attribute to the scrollbar, so it reacts Up, Down, Page&nbsp;Up and Page&nbsp;Down keys.
		<br/>One unfortunate thing is that you can't see part of the row at the bottom of the list, instead there's empty space.
		You can set <i>ShowPartialRow = true</i> attribute for the vertical Align control to make that row visible.
		To make it partially visible you can place a picture with the bottom part of the dialog on top of it.
		<br/>Note: controls are placed in order in which they are added to the dialog,
		i.e. each control is placed on top of controls that go before it.</p>
	<div class="img"><img src="./img/T1S4.png" /></div>


	<h1>Tutorial 2. Pick one of many items.</h1>
	<p>As you know, <i>IF:Q</i> only offers a dialog in which you can choose between 2 options.
		In this tutorial we'll create a dialog for any number of options, specifically 3.</p>
	
	<h3><u>Step 1.</u> Simply 3 pictures.</h3>
	<p>We start with something simple, just a row of 3 pictures, a caption and a button.
		The dialog itself has automatic border and again automatic size calculation works right for us.</p>
	<div class="img"><img src="./img/T2S1.png" /></div>
	
	<h3><u>Step 2.</u> Adding captions, making it pretty.</h3>
	<p>Now we're making it prettier by adding captions, using proper font size and color and adding a box around the button.
		The numbers between controls in AlignV add space between them. I've even removed <i>SpaceY</i> attribute, because all spaces are different.
		<br/>The box aroung the button is placed using <i>AlignLayers</i> control. It places contained controls on top of each other.
		<i>AlignX = 0.5</i> and <i>AlignX = 0.5</i> attributes place the button in the center of the box.</p>
	<div class="img"><img src="./img/T2S2.png" /></div>
	
	<h3><u>Step 3.</u> Just playng with different pictures.</h3>
	<p>Not much to learn here, except the fact that we're using Pcx control the first time.</p>
	<div class="img"><img src="./img/T2S3.png" /></div>
	
	<h3><u>Step 4.</u> Cancel button.</h3>
	<p>Here we add Cancel button which is there when <i>AllowCancel</i> variable is <i>true</i>.
		We use a few Align controls for this.</p>
	<div class="img"><img src="./img/T2S4.png" /></div>
	
	<h3><u>Step 5.</u> Selection frames and automated list creation.</h3>
	<p>There are 2 ways to go. We could make one selection frame and move it between the pictures, 
		or we could use a separate frame for each of them, but show only the active frame.
		I chose the letter because at first I wanted the frames to surround both picture and text, so
		invisible frames played extra role of denoting the clickable area around each option.
		<br/>As we want this test to become a library function in the end, we're making options creation dynamic.
		<i>choices</i> table containing just the pictures is used as the input.
		<i>Caption</i> is not a standard attribute, so we can give it our meaning, i.e. text under the pictue.
		We loop through the pictures and populate the list with proper display.
		Also note that frame color is taken from <i>game.pal</i>, as it is in the standard <i>IF:Q</i> dialog.</p>
	<div class="img"><img src="./img/T2S5.png" /></div>
	
	<h3><u>Step 6.</u> Picking one.</h3>
	<p>Adding the OnClick event to all frames that shows the selection frame and enables OK button.</p>
	<div class="img"><img src="./img/T2S6.png" /></div>
	
	<h3><u>Step 7.</u> Right click hints, returning dialog result.</h3>
	<p>Here we're adding right-click hints for the options. <i>ShowLongHints = true</i> makes the 
		dialog show <i>LongHint</i> of control on right click. When <i>LongHint</i> is <i>nil</i>, <i>Hint</i> is used instead.
		<br/>The last thing is the result of future library function. If OK was clicked we'll return chosen option number, otherwise we'll return 0.
		<i>Show()</i> method returns chosen item id, or <i>30721</i> if the dialog was closed by other means.
		<br/>Note: <i>30722</i> and <i>30721</i> are standard OK and Cancel ids in the game, we use them for the sake of tradition.</p>
	<div class="img"><img src="./img/T2S7.png" /></div>


	<h1>Tutorial 3. Context Menu.</h1>
	<p>In this tutorial we will create a context menu.</p>
		
	<h3><u>Step 1.</u> Basic menu.</h3>
	<p>CheckGroup control would help us with the menu. Normally it's used to create a list of check boxes or radio buttons.
		We use check boxes with <i>States = 1</i> to get them to act as buttons.</p>
	<div class="img"><img src="./img/T3S1.png" /></div>

	<h3><u>Step 2.</u> Area outside of the menu and caption.</h3>
	<p>Context menus disappear when you click outside the menu or press Esc. We'll do it as well.
		Esc key is simple, the only important detail is that it has to go in <i>OnKeyUp</i> event instead of <i>OnKeyDown</i>,
		otherwise pressing Esc will close the dialog under ours if there is one.
		Clicking outside of the dialog is a bit tricky. Click events only fire when a dialog control is clicked.
		Custom dialogs have their area covered with control named "DialogArea", so clicks inside the dialog fire click events.
		To catch clicks outside of the dialog we create a transparent <i>Area</i> control, making sure it covers whole screen.
		The dialog size is then set manually to that of actual contents. In <i>OnClick</i> and <i>OnRightClick</i> events
		we close the dialog if the click occured outside of its area. We'll also add a caption, just in case.</p>
	<div class="img"><img src="./img/T3S2.png" /></div>

	<h3><u>Step 3.</u> Appearing at mouse position and returning chosen item index.</h3>
	<p>To open the menu at the place of mouse click we use new reciever <i>UX:M</i> which gets us mouse coordinates.
		CheckGroup control sets ItemIndex property of contained check boxes (counting is done from 1, as always in Lua), so
		that's what we need as the result from context menu.</p>
	
	<h3><u>Step X.</u> ScrollBar Example.</h3>
	<p>This step shows a scroll bar outside of Align control (CheckGroup is a descendant of Align control).
		When scroll bar is outside, you can assign its name to <i>ScrollBar</i> property.
		There's no use for scroll bar when there are 6 menu items and I don't think someone would need a menu with a lot of items,
		so this step is just educational.</p>
	<div class="img"><img src="./img/T3SX.png" /></div>
	
	<h3><u>Step Y.</u> Hand-Made Dialog Box.</h3>
	<p>Before I figured I can simply add a big invisible control to capture clicks outside of dialog area I tried another approach.
		Here we have an invisible dialog that occupies whole screen and manually created dialog box, layered under the content.
		This is a good example of Align controls use. It also demonstrates <i>Tile</i> property of Def and Pcx controls.</p>
