636	Our initial landing has captured a devastated outpost.  Information is scarce and unreliable at best.  Neighboring citizens have fled their villages.  Remaining survivors tell conflicting stories.  Evidence points to a Nighon invasion.  Rally local militia and train them quickly.  Destroy all hostile forces you encounter.  Assume the worst.  Assume we are at war.
637	Pressing toward Erathia’s capitol of Steadwick, we have encountered peasants talking of Fair Feather, a town to the north. Though surrounded, it has withstood the Nighon invasion.  Reports are unconfirmed, but these peasants believe 'angels' watch over the town.  Angels have been spotted in Erathia before. During the Kreegan infestation, scattered reports told of winged beings massacring large Kreegan forces. Either the angels have returned, or they never left. How long Fair Feather can last against the Nighon and Kreegan onslaught is unknown.  If Fair Feather falls, a potential ally may be lost.
638	Each year, griffins from around the world migrate to Griffin Cliff.  Armies of King Gryphonheart the First tamed the griffins and trained them for war. With these great beasts, King Gryphonheart unified the divergent human colonies and formed Erathia. King Gryphonheart felt the land’s native griffins were key to any Erathian war. To secure Steadwick, we need the griffins.
639	Early intelligence reports forces from Nighon and Eeofol have barricaded themselves inside Steadwick. All land access to the capitol has been blocked. Their reinforcements arrive via underground tunnels. Armies from the west will meet us on the field of battle. There is little else to say. We do not stop until Steadwick is liberated.
640	My name is Dorrell, ambassador from AvLee. I bring a message from Queen Catherine. After the liberation of Steadwick, a Kreegan envoy appeared before the royal court. He claims they have captive, King Roland Ironfist of Enroth. They are asking for one million gold ransom. We cannot validate this claim. True or not, Queen Catherine is unwilling to pay.  After interrogating the envoy, we learned Roland is held deep inside Eeofol by Clan Kreelah. Locate Clan Kreelah's base of operations and rescue Roland.  In addition to your Erathian army, we will support you from AvLee. This mission is of utmost seriousness. You may rescue Roland, or find yourself the victim of a trap.
641	My name is Winstan Langer, ambassador from Bracada, ruled by Grand Vizier Gavin Magnus. Forces from Tatalia and Krewlod are fighting in west Erathia. After months of conflict, the battle still rages.  Though weary of yet another war, my king sends reinforcements to aid your efforts.  Brilliant tactics will not win this battle. Body count will determine the victor. Good luck.
642	We now know how Erathia fell to Nighon and Eeofol. Through an extensive network of underground tunnels dug by the Overlord’s armies, they struck simultaneously in many areas with overwhelming numbers. Credit the military for holding the invasion to half the country.  We have discovered the main artery for transporting forces from Nighon to Erathia; it is under the ocean, connecting the Nighon underworld to the Erathian mainland. Bracada and Avlee have sent armies to join the fight.  First we must eliminate the remaining Kreegans and Nighon forces from the mainland, then pursue them underground, and drive them back to the shores of Nighon.
643	As you foresaw milord, King Gryphonheart’s death brings many opportunities for your mercenary skills.  A messenger from Tatalia, on behalf of King Tralossk, has contacted us.  Twenty years ago, following numerous border skirmishes along the western shore of Erathia, Tatalia signed an agreement to cease hostilities. King Gryphonheart is dead.  Their agreement has died with him.  Aggressive tactics have never been part of Tatalia's military character.  Their ranks are vast, and once they possess Erathian land, they will hold it.  However, they need generals to guide their heroes to expand their borders and accommodate their growing population.
644	Your abilities have been brought to the attention of the barbarian nation of Krewlod. Their skirmishes with the Erathian military on their eastern border are legendary. Many credit them for hardening Erathian soldiers. Recently, a border raid resulted in victory, and uncharacteristically, a large numbers of prisoners. Upon interrogation, their suspicions were confirmed. Without King Gryphonheart, Erathia has lost its soul.  Your goal is to quickly plunder the Erathian land within Krewlod’s immediate reach. Once they have the resources they need... war will be discussed. Until then, your independent participation is needed.  Should you be captured, Krewlod will claim you were an over zealous clan leader, acting outside the interests of the nation.
645	Representatives from both Tatalia and Krewlod seek your services... again. Both nations claim the last strip of Erathian land between their countries. Few Erathian castles remain in the area.  They are nothing more than token resistance.  The most ferocious battles will occur between Tatalia and Krewlod.  Ironically, this land has little value. This is a border war. Tatalia seeks to further extend its reach from the lowlands to the hills. Krewlod wants to halt Tatalia’s march before it reaches their northern border. No matter which side you fight for, the other will perceive you as a traitor. Choose wisely.  Choose the winning side.  Your life depends upon it.
646	Upon liberating Steadwick, my fears were confirmed.  My father did not die of natural causes.  He was poisoned. Investigations conducted by General Morgan Kendal prior to the war yielded no suspects. Now I learn the necromancers, seeking a military tactician equal to myself, have resurrected my father, King Gryphonheart. After killing King Vilmar, he took command of their military and their throne.  Now they come to us.  They cannot stop the monster they have created.  As a gesture of good faith, they send a messenger to speak only to me. He will tell me who killed my father. Find this hero and deliver him to me safely.
647	I grow weary of this war. So do the necromancers. We have agreed to co-operate in the destruction of King Gryphonheart. I never thought I would fight alongside the necromancers, but today we forge weapons for both our armies. With their help, along with the forces from Bracada and AvLee, we should be able to repel all undead from Erathia.
648	What remains of my father's undead army is the Necropolis where he resides. His last legions of undead are significant.  I will join this difficult battle, but you will command the field.  There is one more order you must follow without question. Lord Haart must not die. He is our traitor. We have confirmed the information the necromancers gave to us. Lord Haart was part of King Vilmar's necromantic cult. With Lord Haart's access to Steadwick, poisoning King Gryphonheart's food was a simple task. Acting on orders from King Vilmar, he sought to avenge the banishment of the necromancers from Erathia. I have special plans for Lord Haart.
649	A large elvish population inhabits Erathia’s southeastern coast.  Green and gold dragons, native to the region, augment their military strength.  Before we conquer this region, and detour our forces to Steadwick, we must annihilate these dragons.  Our Kreegan allies from Eeofol requested the honor of this mission.  The Kreegans are fierce warriors.  They will enjoy the slaughter.
650	Reports claim a fleet of Enrothian warships have landed on the southern coast of Erathia. We do not know who commands this force, or its size. Through sources in Eeofol, we know Roland Ironfist cannot lead this fleet. Regardless, our plans remain unchanged.  We start the last phase of our underground invasion and solidify our position along the southeastern coast.  Afterwards, we can transport more reinforcements from Nighon.  We have dug the last tunnels to this area.  You will have the tactical advantage.
651	Catherine Ironfist has enlisted aid from Bracada and AvLee.  She knows we are close to Steadwick.  We must occupy Steadwick before she arrives.  Once we own Erathia's capitol, not even Catherine Ironfist will wrench it from our hands.
652	Our nation's goal was to kill the man who banished us from Erathia. However, Nighon and Eeofol's subsequent invasion has done us an unexpected favor.  Erathia is strewn with the dead.  For the necromancers, this is a season of harvest. This is a season for war.  Queen Catherine is a formidable foe. To defeat Erathia's remaining military, we need a tactician greater than her. We have a plan... an ironic plan. While Catherine organizes the last stages of her war with Nighon and Eeofol, you will sneak into Erathia and locate King Gryphonheart’s grave. Be wary. The region is occupied by scattered Erathian. When the gravesite is found, we will resurrect the dead king and make him our pawn. With King Gryphonheart commanding our armies, his former home will become our land of the dead.
653	Before we begin our large scale invasion of Erathia, we must fill our ranks. Erathia’s populous will provide the recruits we need. Invade the local region and resurrect the needed troops.
654	A Death Knight named Mot, refuses to obey King Gryphonheart’s orders.  An example must be made so others will not contemplate such traitorous action.  Mot has insulated himself with his armies.  Infiltrate his troops, kill him, and take his command.  When he is dead, resurrect his corpse and employ him in your ranks.
655	Erathia's military lies before us. It is time to make a bold strike. King Gryphonheart has trained their generals and knows their tactics. Morale will decide this battle.  Morale is not a factor for the undead.  Once we fill our ranks with their dead, our horde will grow and their morale will falter.  Then we will swarm over them. Soon King Gryphonheart will rule Erathia once again.
656	For the first time in the history of the Contested Lands, humans and elves have fought alongside one another to defend the region from invaders. When the celebration is over, old hatreds will return and we will be citizens of a land in conflict. We must think about the future of the Contested Lands.  It is time to shape its future.  If our fight for independence is to succeed, we need something greater than our armies to motivate the populous. We need a symbolic cornerstone. Seek out the Grail in the enchanted lands where the Unicorns converse with the trees.
657	Our cause is public.  Ironically, many humans have joined the elfin population in our vision of an independent state. Already, factions loyal to Erathia and AvLee organize to stop us. We cannot continue without a strong base of operations. Faruk Welnin, mayor of the town of Welnin, has sent a messenger.  He offers his protection and support. Our war for independence begins now. We must fight our way to Welnin and establish the Grail. When we have accomplished this, Welnin will become our foundation.
658	We have come far very quickly. Armies from Erathia and AvLee have arrived to 'restore order.' This jeopardizes our quest for independence, and such hostile elements could ignite a larger war. It is our duty to establish Welnin as the capitol of the Contested Lands and the drive rule of Erathia and AvLee from this territory. If we do not, we will lose all we have fought for and two great nations may once again re-enact the carnage of the Timber Wars.  Today we declare our independence from the nations of Erathia and AvLee.
659	While resurrecting King Gryphonheart from the dead, former King Vilmar met with an unfortunate accident. King Gryphonheart has taken command of the military... and the throne. His control over the dead is beyond anything we have seen. This bodes well for our invasion. However, our lords watch their new king, searching for a sign of weakness.

2874	{Southport}

Queen Catherine has departed to elicit military support from King Gavin Magnus of Bracada. Other generals are fanning through the region. Establish a base of operations, rally local militia, determine the extent of the Nighon occupation, and find their invasion route.
2875	{Angelgate}

Reports of Angels near the town of Fair Feather deserve our investigation. If the rumors are true, then we must ensure the safety of this town, and perhaps convince the Angels to ally with us.
2876	{Griffin Cliff}

The region of Griffin Cliff, the annual breeding grounds from which nearly all of Erathia's Griffin population comes from, is currently under the control of the combined Nighon and Kreegan forces. Generations ago, the Griffins were key to building Erathia, and today they are key to reclaiming it.
2877	{Battlestead}

The first step in our fight to free Erathia is to liberate the capital of Steadwick from Nighon occupation. This will not be an easy task, as the Dungeon Overlords have blocked the mountain passes leading into the Steadwick Valley.
2878	{Eeofol}

A letter from Lucifer Kreegan III, Lord High Commander of Eeofol, arrives at the palace for Queen Catherine. In it he claims that he holds a captive, Catherine's husband, Roland Ironfist of Enroth, and that only a one million gold ransom can save him.
2879	{Marshland & Hillbridge}

An ambassador from Bracada brings a message from his leader, Gavin Magnus, offering aid in reclaiming Western Erathia from the marauding Tatalian and Krewlish forces. It is time to remind your neighbors of where their borders belong.
2880	{Grainrich & Firecoast}

We now know how Erathia fell to Nighon and Eeofol. They literally tunneled their way under the Nighon Straits, breaking into the Dwarven Tunnels along Erathia's coast. We must now force them to use the tunnels again - this time as an escape route as we drive them from Erathia's lands forever!
2881	{Marshland}

You are offered a mercenary contract with King Tralossk of Tatalia, who once and for all wishes for his nation to be made up of something more than just swampland. With Erathia distracted, he has decided that now is the time to expand Tatalia's borders.
2882	{Minewell}

Duke Winston Boragus, leader of Krewlod, has offered you a mercenary contract which will require you to make a series of raids into Erathian territory. The plan is to plunder enough gold to allow the armies of Krewlod to purchase what it would need for... other things.
2883	{Hillbridge}

Both King Tralossk of Tatalia and Duke Boragus of Krewlod are seeking your services. Both nations are poised to claim the last strip of land between their countries. Ironically, this land has little value. You must decide which nation to serve. The choice is yours alone.
2884	{Forestlow}

A Necromancer is attempting to reach an Erathian outpost with proof of who killed King Gryphonheart. He is currently safe, but his way is blocked by undead loyal to their new King. You must escort him on the last leg of the journey.
2885	{Emerald Hills to Woodgrove}

You command the combined armies of Erathia, AvLee, and Bracada, plus the Necromancers that have chosen to fight with you against King Gryphonheart. The undead presence is strong, but you must prevail!
2886	{Marble Garden}

This is the final battle. Our presence has already begun to restore life to the land, but we must destroy this last fortress of death that King Gryphonheart has retreated to. It is time to return the dead to their graves.
2887	{Rionpoint}

Before Erathia has a chance to call upon the elves of AvLee for assistance, we have decided to strike at the heart of AvLee's strength - the Gold Dragon Queen. By eliminating the elves' strongest ally, they will be unable to lend aid to Erathia.
2888	{Grainrich}

Our forces will cover most of the distance to the Erathian capitol by using underground tunnels. To maintain the element of surprise, you must attack any Erathian settlement you find. Use the vast network of caves in this area to accomplish this goal.
2889	{Battlestead}

Assault the Erathian capital of Steadwick. This won't be easy, as the capital is easily and well defended. To make matters worse, the force led by Queen Catherine is on the move. We must capture Steadwick before she arrives!
2890	{Marble Garden}

King Gryphonheart, the man who banished us from Erathia, is dead. The Nighon and Eeofol invasion has given us the gift of death. At last we can build our armies and invade Erathia ourselves. First, however, we need a tactician. You must find the tomb of King Gryphonheart.
2891	{Emerald Hills}

We have found a perfect area along Erathia's border from which we can harvest enough creatures for our armies without attracting much notice from the Erathian Military. Build an army, but be quick - we need those troops immediately.
2892	{Strongwillow & Woodgrove}

A rogue Death Knight does not wish to take part in the glory that will be our invasion of Erathia. He believes that by remaining out of the fighting, his lands will be spared from any counterattack by the Erathians. It is time we taught him a small lesson regarding obedience.
2893	{Forestbury}

The time has come. The lich King Gryphonheart has chosen this as the moment of attack. Forces from across Deyja will pour into Erathia and overwhelm them. The point of your attack was chosen by King Gryphonheart himself. You have vowed not to fail.
2894	{Cloverfield}

Before we can declare our independence we will need a symbol. That symbol is the Grail, which was lost in this area centuries ago. We must find it, or our plan will dissolve even before we can set it in motion. You have but three months to locate the Grail.
2895	{Forestdale}

The journey to Welnin has not been easy, but it is the last leg of the journey that will be the most difficult. The Ranger, Ryland, has the Grail, and must elude the forces loyal to Erathia and AvLee to reach Welnin. Once there, he must order the construction of a permanent home for the Grail.
2896	{Mosswood}

The Grail has reached Welnin, but now we must build this city into a capital. Armies from Erathia and AvLee shall attack us from all directions. Soon we shall prove that the Contested Lands are theirs no more!
